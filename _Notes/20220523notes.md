## persistent volume/persistent volume claim
* A volume can be thought of as a directory accessible to the containers in a pod.
* The concept of a volume existed with Docker, the issue was that the volume attached to a container was removed when the lifecycle of the container was over
* Volumes created with Kubernetes are not limited to any particular container
## types of volumes
### `emptyDir`
* initally empty
* containers can read/write to it
* erased when the pod is removed
### `hostPath`
### `gccPersistentDisk`
### `ebs`
### `nfs`
### `iscsi`
### `cephfs`
### `secret`
### `configMap`
### `persistentVolumeClaim`
### `downwardAPI`
## exYAMpL
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - name: pod-volume-container
    image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    volumeMounts:
    - name: test-volume
      mountPath: /test-pd
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
      hostPath:
        path: "/home/mike"
        type: directory
```
## persistent volumes
When creating a pod with a persistent volume:
1. Create the Persistent Volume
2. Create the Persistent Volume Claim
3. Create the pod
This is a common question on the CKA exam. Yaml manifests for the PV/PVC can be found in the Kubernetes official documentation.

  name: task-pv-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: task-pv-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: task-pv-storage
  volumes:
  - name: task-pv-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: task-pv-claim
```
