## role based access control
* Rules that represent a set of permissions within a namespace.
* Permissions are only "allowed" not "denied"
### roles
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
## role binding
* grants permissions defined by a role to a user or set of users
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# This role binding allows "jane" to read pods in the "default" namespace.
# You need to already have a Role named "pod-reader" in that namespace.
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
# You can specify more than one "subject"
- kind: User
  name: jane # "name" is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  # "roleRef" specifies the binding to a Role / ClusterRole
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  ```
## testing permissions
```bash
kubectl auth can-i <verb> <resource> --as <user>
```
## service accounts
* Service accounts are for processes, which run in pods
* User accounts are for humans
```bash
# imperative example
kubectl create serviceaccount <name>
kubectl create sa <name>
```
