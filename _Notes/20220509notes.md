## Microservices
Microservices decouple an application to provide:
* greater security
* greater reliability
* easier maintenance
## Problems before Virtualization
* Buying servers was expensive
* Resources not being utilized at full potential
* Process of getting any software up and running was time consuming
* Disaster recovery was difficult
## Monolithic Application
A Monolithic application doesn't isolate services. Any changes to a single service affect the entire application.
