* interact with k8s using cli (`kubectl`) or ui.
## master components
**etcd** - key value store accessible via api
**api server** - front end for the control plane. exposes k8s api.
**scheduler** - allocates tasks to nodes.
**controller manager** - runs all the controllers on the cluster. although each controller is a separate process, they are combined into a single process.
**kubelet** - creates pods for each node and monitors the health of the node.
**kube proxy** - manages communication between nodes.
## resources
**pods** can have one or more containers coupled together. They are the basic unit of Kubernetes.
**services** are used to load balance the traffic among the pods.
**ingress** is an object that allows access to your k8s services from outside the cluster.
