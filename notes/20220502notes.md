## switch case
```bash
CARS="bmw"

# Pass the variable in string
case "$CARS" in
    #case 1
    "mercedes") echo "Headquarters - Affalterbach, Germany" ;;

    #case 2 
    "audi") echo "Headquarters - Ingolstadt, Germany" ::

    #case 3
    "bmw") echo "Headquarters - Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"
    
    #default
    *) echo "Enter the correct value" ;;
ecase

# if/else example

if [ $CARS == 'bmw' ]
then
    echo "Headquarters - Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"
elif [ $CARS == 'audi' ]
then
    echo "Headquarters - Ingolstadt, Germany"
elif [ $CARS  == 'bmw' ]
then
    echo "Headquarters - Ingolstadt, Germany"

```
Example:
Enter a number: display that number in words
e.g.
1 -> one
2 -> two
...
```bash
echo "Pls enter a number"
read number

if [ $number == 1 ]
then
    echo "ONE"
else
    echo "Enter correct number"
```
An application's UI is similar to a joke. It should not have to be explained to be understood.

## looping
for/while
```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo $i
done
```

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
## functions
Use for repetitive tasks, code reusability.
```bash
# echo Hello world every 3 lines.
Hello () {
    echo "Hello World"
}

echo "This is my first"
echo "This is second line"
Hello
echo "This is fourth line"
echo "This is fifth line"
Hello
```
An example using parameters:
```bash
Hello () {
    echo "Hello World $2 $1"
}

Hello lastName firstName
```
## pass arguments
```bash
echo '(The first fruit is: $1")
echo '(The second fruit is: $2")
echo '(The third fruit is: $3")
echo '(All fruits are: $@")

sh 4_operators.sh Apple Grapes Mango
```
Automation means zero manual input. Try to avoid `read`.
## special variables
```bash
$0 - The filename of the current script.
$# - The number of arguments supplied to a script.
$n - position of an argument (the first argument is $1, the second argument is $2)
$? - The exit status of the last command executed.
$* - All the arguments are double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $* is equivalent to $1 $2.
$@ - All the arguments are individually double quoted. If a script receives two arguments, $@ is equivalent to $1 $2.
```
`$?`  will be 0 if the last command executed successfully.
